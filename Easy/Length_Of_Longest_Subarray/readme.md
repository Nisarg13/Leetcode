# Maximum Length Subarray Summing to K

## Overview

This is a Python code implementation for finding the maximum length of a subarray in a given list of integers `nums` such that the sum of the elements in the subarray is less than or equal to a specified target value `k`. Additionally, it returns the subarray itself.

## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, you need to find the maximum length of a subarray such that the sum of its elements is less than or equal to `k`. You are required to return both the maximum length and the subarray.

### Example

```python
Input: nums = [3, 1, 2, 7, 4, 2, 1, 1, 5], k = 8
Output: (4, [3, 1, 2, 2])
```

In this example, the subarray `[3, 1, 2, 2]` has a sum of 8, which is the maximum sum less than or equal to `k`. The length of this subarray is 4.

## Code Explanation

The provided Python code accomplishes the task of finding the maximum length subarray with a sum less than or equal to `k`. Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. Initialize variables `left`, `curr`, and `ans` to 0. `left` represents the left boundary of the current subarray, `curr` keeps track of the current sum of the elements in the window, and `ans` stores the maximum length found so far.

2. Iterate through the `nums` list using a sliding window approach. The `right` pointer is used to expand the window to the right.

3. Add the element at the `right` pointer to the current sum `curr`.

4. Check if the current sum `curr` exceeds the target sum `k`. If it does, enter a while loop to shrink the window from the left by subtracting the element at the `left` pointer from `curr` and incrementing `left`. This ensures that the sum stays less than or equal to `k`.

5. Inside the loop, calculate the length of the current subarray as `right - left + 1`. If this length is greater than the previously stored `ans`, update `ans` to the new length and keep track of the start and end indices of this subarray in `subarray_start` and `subarray_end`.

6. After the loop, check if a valid subarray was found. If `subarray_start` and `subarray_end` are not -1, return the maximum length `ans` and the corresponding subarray using slicing.

7. If no valid subarray is found, return 0 and an empty list to indicate that no subarray meets the criteria.

## Usage

To use this code for finding the maximum length subarray summing to a given target `k`, follow these steps:

1. Copy the provided code into your Python environment.

2. Call the `find_length` function, passing in the list of integers `nums` and the target sum `k`.

3. The function will return a tuple containing the maximum length and the subarray meeting the criteria.

```python
result_length, result_subarray = find_length([3, 1, 2, 7, 4, 2, 1, 1, 5], 8)
print("Maximum Length:", result_length)
print("Subarray:", result_subarray)
```

This code can be customized for different input lists and target sums to find the maximum length subarray efficiently.
