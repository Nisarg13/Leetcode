# Longest Substring with One Flip

This Python code snippet demonstrates how to find the length of the longest substring containing only "1" in a binary string, with the option to flip a single "0" to "1" if needed.

## Problem Description

Given a binary string `s` consisting of "0"s and "1"s, you are allowed to flip at most one "0" to "1." The goal is to find the length of the longest substring in which all characters are "1"s.

## Approach

The code utilizes a sliding window approach to solve this problem efficiently. Here's a brief overview of the approach:

1. Initialize variables `left`, `curr`, and `ans` to 0. `left` represents the left pointer of the window, `curr` keeps track of the number of "0"s in the current window, and `ans` stores the length of the longest substring.

2. Iterate through the binary string `s` using a right pointer (`right`) to expand the window.

3. If the character at the `right` pointer is "0," increment the `curr` count.

4. Use a while loop to maintain the condition that `curr` should not exceed 1. If `curr` becomes greater than 1, start moving the left pointer (`left`) to shrink the window until `curr` becomes 1 again. This step is necessary because we are allowed to flip at most one "0" to "1," so we ensure that only one "0" is present in the window.

5. Update the `ans` variable with the maximum length found during each iteration.

6. Finally, return the value of `ans`, which represents the length of the longest substring containing only "1"s.

## Code Usage

You can use the `find_length` function provided in the code snippet to find the length of the longest substring with one flip for a given binary string.

```python
# Example usage:
s = "1101100111"
result = find_length(s)
print("Length of the longest substring with one flip:", result)
```

This will output: `Length of the longest substring with one flip: 5`, as explained in the example.
